# The Exploration vs Exploitation Dilemma

This project aims to explore various algorithms for solving the exploration-exploitation dilemma, with a specific focus on the application of these concepts in artificial intelligence dedicated to games. Our first step will involve studying the game **Connect Four** as well as the **Multi-Bandit Arm**.


## Connect Four
This first part of the project allowed us to create strategies played by two players. The first strategy involves using a random approach by choosing moves at random. The second strategy is an implementation of the Monte Carlo algorithm, which allows us to build a strategy that wins almost every time.


## Multi-Bandit Arm
The second part of the project involves finding parameters to balance the exploration of possibilities and the exploitation of a found value to choose the maximum gain among multiple slot machines. For this purpose, we implemented random, epsilon-greedy, and UCB strategies.
